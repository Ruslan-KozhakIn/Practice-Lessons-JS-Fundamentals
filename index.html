<h1 class="head-title">Java Review</h1>  
<p class="head-descr">JavaScript was created in 1995 by Brandon Ike at Netscape as a scripting language in Netscape Navigator 2. Originally,
the language was called LiveScript. Syntax formation was influenced by C and Java, and since Java was very popular at
the time, LiveScript was renamed JavaScript in 1995.
